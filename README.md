# NamesOfSweden
An web-app that tells you the most popular names in Sweden. You can also log in anonymously and save some of your favourite searches.

The specifications for this code was that it had to use a database, and the SCB (Statistiska Central Byr√•n)'s API. 

# Why JQuery?
It's already used for bootstrap, which I used for layout and responsivity, so it was one less lib to incorporate into the web app.

I also feel most comfortable with JQuery, which is why I used it for the part that was newest to me, using a RESTful API.

# Why vanilla javascript?

Really, all libraries that builds upon javascript are, well, built on javascript.

# Why not Typescript?
As there was rules to this, I were not sure if Typescript was allowed. Also, see "Why vanilla javascript?". It's easy when you make it easy. I guess it's kind of obvious that I prefer typescript and object oriented languages (such as python and c++).

# Why Bootstrap?
It fitted the style of the web app, which is clearly split into rows-then-columns.

* Why not a jumbotron? It works pretty well without it, does it not? :)

# Why Firebase?
Because I've never used it before, and after some research, it seemed like an easy enough way to handle a database.

I am actually a bit disappointed in how rigid it felt to work with compared to SQL-based databases. 

# What's next?

* I've thought about using Angular or Angularjs with in the project. I am definitely considering it!
* Adding Google as a log-in alternative. I begun with it, but I wanted to accomplish other things with the code before diving my head into it :)
